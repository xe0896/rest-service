## Installation

To use this program clone this repo using this command in the terminal:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/xe0896/rest-service
```
Then go to the branch that actually has some cool stuff by doing:
```powershell
git checkout rest-react
```
To allow ourselves to use React, we must do the following to include the `node_modules` folder which has all the relevant React code, I have `.gitignore` the file since updates may occur
```powershell
npm install
```

More dependencies may arise..

## Documentation
